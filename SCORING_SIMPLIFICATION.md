# Scoring System Simplification

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Simplified the STIG recommendation scoring system by removing the confusing dual-scale approach (relevance 0-10 and confidence 0-100) and standardizing on a single **Confidence Score** (0-100%).

## Problem Identified

**Before:**
- ❌ Two different scoring scales were confusing
  - Relevance Score: 0-10 scale
  - Confidence Score: 0-100 scale
- ❌ Users couldn't easily compare or understand the relationship
- ❌ Unclear which score was more important

**After:**
- ✅ Single unified **Confidence Score** (0-100%)
- ✅ Clear, intuitive percentage-based scoring
- ✅ Recommendations sorted by highest confidence first
- ✅ Cleaner UI with 3-column metrics grid

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model (`utils/stigFamilyRecommendations.ts`)

**Removed:**
```typescript
relevanceScore: number; // REMOVED
```

**Interface now:**
```typescript
export interface StigFamilyRecommendation {
  stigFamily: StigFamily;
  confidenceScore: number; // 0-100 confidence (ONLY score)
  matchingRequirements: string[];
  matchingDesignElements: string[];
  reasoning: string[];
  implementationPriority: 'Critical' | 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low';
  scoreBreakdown: { ... };
}
```

### 2. Scoring Thresholds

**Updated from relevance thresholds to confidence thresholds:**

```typescript
const SCORING_WEIGHTS = {
  // ... other weights
  MIN_CRITICAL_CONFIDENCE: 80,  // Was: MIN_CRITICAL_SCORE: 12
  MIN_HIGH_CONFIDENCE: 60,      // Was: MIN_HIGH_SCORE: 8
  MIN_MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE: 40     // Was: MIN_MEDIUM_SCORE: 4
};
```

**Priority Determination:**
- **Critical**: Confidence ≥ 80% AND STIG priority = High
- **High**: Confidence ≥ 60% OR STIG priority = High
- **Medium**: Confidence ≥ 40% OR STIG priority = Medium
- **Low**: Confidence < 40%

### 3. Sorting Algorithm

**Changed from:**
```typescript
// Sort by relevance, then by confidence
return recommendations.sort((a, b) => {
  if (b.relevanceScore !== a.relevanceScore) {
    return b.relevanceScore - a.relevanceScore;
  }
  return b.confidenceScore - a.confidenceScore;
});
```

**To:**
```typescript
// Sort by confidence score only (highest confidence first)
return recommendations.sort((a, b) => {
  return b.confidenceScore - a.confidenceScore;
});
```

### 4. UI Component (`components/StigFamilyRecommendations.tsx`)

**Metrics Grid:**
- Changed from 4 columns to 3 columns
- Removed "Relevance Score" column
- Kept: Requirements, Confidence Score, Est. Effort

**Before:**
```
| Requirements | Relevance Score | Confidence | Est. Effort |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| 165          | 8.5/10          | 75%        | 83 days     |
```

**After:**
```
| Requirements | Confidence Score | Est. Effort |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| 165          | 75%              | 83 days     |
```

**Score Breakdown:**
- Footer now shows "Confidence Score: 75%" instead of "Total Score: 8.5/10"
- Clearer indication that all breakdown components contribute to confidence

## User Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Single percentage-based score is intuitive
2. **Consistency**: No confusion about which score matters
3. **Sorting**: Highest confidence recommendations appear first
4. **Simplicity**: Cleaner UI with fewer redundant metrics
5. **Trust**: Percentage format familiar from other rating systems

## Technical Details

### Confidence Score Calculation (0-100)

The confidence score is calculated based on:

1. **Requirement Matches** (up to 30 points)
   - 10 points per matching requirement (max 3)

2. **Design Element Matches** (up to 40 points)
   - 15 points per matching design element (max ~2.67)

3. **Validation Bonus** (+10 points)
   - If STIG is validated against DISA

4. **Technology Match Bonus** (+20 points)
   - If exact technology match detected

**Formula:**
```
confidence = min(
  (reqMatches * 10, max 30) +
  (designMatches * 15, max 40) +
  (validated ? 10 : 0) +
  (exactTechMatch ? 20 : 0),
  100
)
```

### Score Breakdown

The score breakdown still shows individual component contributions:
- Keyword Matches
- Control Family Matches  
- Design Element Matches
- Technology Bonus
- Environment Bonus
- Penalties

These components help users understand **why** a STIG has its confidence score.

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**
- No compilation errors
- All TypeScript types validated
- UI components render correctly
- Production build optimized

## Migration Notes

No database migration needed - this is a calculation-only change. Existing data is compatible.

## Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ Verify highest confidence STIGs appear first
2. ✅ Check that confidence scores range from 0-100%
3. ✅ Confirm priority badges match confidence thresholds
4. ✅ Test score breakdown displays correctly
5. ✅ Validate sorting works with multiple recommendations

## Conclusion

The scoring system is now streamlined with a single, clear confidence percentage. Users can easily identify the most relevant STIGs (highest confidence) and understand the scoring through the transparent breakdown.

**Status: Production Ready** ✅
