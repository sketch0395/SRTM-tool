# Overall Categorization Calculation Fix

## Issue Identified
The overall system categorization was incorrectly allowing manual overrides and potentially showing "Moderate" when all individual impact levels were "Low".

## Root Cause
1. **Manual Override Problem**: The overall categorization had editable dropdowns that allowed users to manually override the calculated values
2. **Calculation Logic**: While the `calculateOverallImpact()` function was correctly implemented, it could be overridden by manual user input
3. **NIST Compliance**: Per NIST SP 800-60, the overall system categorization MUST be automatically determined as the highest impact level among all information types

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Read-Only Overall Categorization**
- Converted overall categorization dropdowns to read-only display fields
- Added color-coded visual indicators:
  - 🔴 **High**: Red background/text
  - 🟡 **Moderate**: Yellow background/text  
  - 🟢 **Low**: Green background/text

### ✅ **Automatic Calculation**
- Added `useEffect` hook to automatically recalculate overall impact whenever information types change
- Maintained existing calculation logic that correctly finds the highest impact level among all CIA values
- Added clear user guidance explaining the auto-calculation

### ✅ **NIST Compliance**
- Overall categorization now strictly follows NIST SP 800-60 guidance
- System categorization = highest impact level among all information types
- No manual override capability to prevent incorrect categorizations

## Calculation Logic (Confirmed Correct)

```typescript
const calculateOverallImpact = () => {
  const types = formData.informationTypes || [];
  if (types.length === 0) return;

  const getHighestImpact = (impacts: string[]) => {
    if (impacts.includes('High')) return 'High';
    if (impacts.includes('Moderate')) return 'Moderate';
    return 'Low';
  };

  const confidentiality = getHighestImpact(types.map(t => t.confidentialityImpact));
  const integrity = getHighestImpact(types.map(t => t.integrityImpact));
  const availability = getHighestImpact(types.map(t => t.availabilityImpact));

  // Sets overall categorization to highest impact in each CIA category
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    overallCategorization: {
      confidentiality: confidentiality as 'Low' | 'Moderate' | 'High',
      integrity: integrity as 'Low' | 'Moderate' | 'High',
      availability: availability as 'Low' | 'Moderate' | 'High'
    }
  }));
};
```

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ **Scenario 1: All Low Impact**
- Information Type 1: Low/Low/Low
- Information Type 2: Low/Low/Low
- **Expected Result**: Overall = Low/Low/Low ✅
- **Previous Issue**: Might have shown Moderate ❌

### ✅ **Scenario 2: Mixed Impact Levels**
- Information Type 1: Low/Moderate/Low
- Information Type 2: High/Low/Moderate
- **Expected Result**: Overall = High/Moderate/Moderate ✅

### ✅ **Scenario 3: Single High Impact**
- Information Type 1: Low/Low/Low
- Information Type 2: Low/High/Low
- **Expected Result**: Overall = Low/High/Low ✅

## UI Improvements

### **Before**
- Editable dropdowns for overall categorization
- No clear indication of auto-calculation
- Risk of manual override errors

### **After**
- Read-only color-coded display fields
- Clear explanation: "Per NIST SP 800-60, the overall system categorization is automatically determined as the highest impact level among all information types"
- Visual feedback with appropriate colors

## Files Modified
- `components/SystemCategorization.tsx`
  - Added `useEffect` for automatic calculation
  - Converted editable dropdowns to read-only displays
  - Added color-coded visual indicators
  - Added user guidance text

## Validation Steps
1. ✅ Create new system categorization
2. ✅ Add information types with all "Low" CIA values
3. ✅ Verify overall categorization shows "Low/Low/Low"
4. ✅ Change one information type to "High" for Confidentiality
5. ✅ Verify overall categorization updates to "High/Low/Low"
6. ✅ Add more information types with mixed values
7. ✅ Verify overall shows highest impact in each category

## NIST SP 800-60 Compliance
The system now correctly implements NIST SP 800-60 Section 3.2:
> "The security categorization of an information system is expressed as the ordered triple:
> SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}
> where the impact values are the highest values from among those information types processed by the information system."
